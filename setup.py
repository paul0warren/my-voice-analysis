My-Voice-Analysis is a Python library for the analysis of voice (simultaneous speech, high entropy) 
without the need of a transcription. It breaks utterances and detects syllable boundaries, fundamental 
frequency contours, and formants. Its built-in functions recognize and measures:

1.	gender recognition, 
2.	speech mood (semantic analysis), 
3.	pronunciation posterior score 
4.	articulation-rate, 
5.	speech rate,
6.	filler words, 
7.	f0 statistics.

The library was developed based upon the idea introduced by Nivja DeJong and Ton Wempe [1], 
Paul Boersma and David Weenink [2], Carlo Gussenhoven [3], S.M Witt and S.J. Young [4] and 
Yannick Jadoul [5].

Peaks in intensity (dB) that are preceded and followed by dips in intensity are considered 
as potential syllable cores. 
My-Voice Analysis is unique in its aim to provide a complete quantitative and analytical way 
to study acoustic features of a speech. Moreover, those features could be analysed further 
by employing Pythonâ€™s functionality to provide more fascinating insights into speech patterns. 
This library is for Linguists, scientists, developers, speech and language therapy clinics and
researchers. Please note that My-Voice Analysis is currently in initial state though in active 
development. While the amount of functionality that is currently present is not huge, more will 
be added over the next few months.
=============
